Allows site administrators to specifically designate arbitrary posts with any public post type as viewable only after user login.

== Description ==

Overview:

  At the time of this writing, the latest version of WordPress, version 4.1,
  has 3 post visibility options, which are 'public', 'password protected', and
  'private'.

  The 'password protected' option allows the site administrator to
  individually lock certain posts, even from the logged in users, with an
  additional password.  However, there is currently no built-in way to just
  deny access only to the unauthenticated users.

  LoginRequirePress is a WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
  specifically designate arbitrary posts with any public post type as viewable
  only after user login.

  Unauthenticated site visitors attempting to view any page that includes any
  such specifically designated post will then be automatically redirected to
  the site's default login page, and then back to the original page after they
  login, thereby limiting access only to logged-in users with subscriber roles
  and above.

  Plugin will still allow unauthenticated downloading of site's feeds, but
  will filter out any login-requiring posts from the feed listings.

Technical summary:

  Plugin works by hooking-in special logic into the action 'send_headers' to
  redirect unauthenticated client browsers to the site's login page from any
  non-feed page upon detecting any login-requiring post, and by hooking-in
  another special logic into the filter 'posts_results' to filter out any
  login-requiring posts from the listing.
