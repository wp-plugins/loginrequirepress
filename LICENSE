  LoginRequirePress -- WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
                       specifically designate arbitrary posts with any public
                       post type as viewable only after user login.

                       Unauthenticated site visitors attempting to view any
                       page that includes any such specifically designated
                       post will then be automatically redirected to the
                       site's default login page, and then back to the
                       original page after they login, thereby limiting access
                       only to logged-in users with subscriber roles and
                       above.

                       Plugin will still allow unauthenticated downloading of
                       site's feeds, but will filter out any login-requiring
                       posts from the feed listings.

                       Plugin will protect the titles and contents of login-
                       requiring posts in search result page listings when the
                       user is not logged in.  The titles / contents will be
                       replaced by text "[Post title / content protected by
                       LoginRequirePress.  Login to see the title / content.]"
